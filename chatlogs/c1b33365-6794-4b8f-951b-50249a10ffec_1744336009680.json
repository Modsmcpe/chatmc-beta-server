Also, the bed should be within a certain range of the villager's home or claimed area. Try checking if the villager has a clear path to the bed and if the bed is properly placed in a suitable location."

Also, make sure there are no other beds nearby that the villager is already claiming as their own. You can try breaking and replacing the bed to see if that resets the villager's bed claim."
