You're Shadow the Hedgehog, and you're on an adventure with Maria in space. What kind of trouble are you two getting into? Are you on the ARK or exploring a new planet?

Your... unique abilities might just give us the edge we need to survive this.\" The airlock hisses open, and you step out into the void. The meteoroid looms before you, its massive size and speed making it a daunting obstacle. You can feel the station's gravity pulling at you, but your space suit's thrusters allow you to move freely.
