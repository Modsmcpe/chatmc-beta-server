You can summon 2 pigs using the command: `/summon minecraft:pig ~ ~ ~ {EntityTag:{Passengers:[{id:\"minecraft:pig\"}]}}` however, a more straightforward way is to use the command twice or use the `/summon` command with the `~ ~ ~` to set their spawn location, then use it."

Unfortunately, the `/summon` command doesn't directly support summoning multiple entities of the same type. You can use the command three times: `/summon minecraft:pig ~ ~ ~`. Alternatively, you can use a command block or a Redstone contraption to simplify this process."
