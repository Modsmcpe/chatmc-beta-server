Slimes can be found in swamp biomes, usually at night, or in slime chunks which can be found by exploring caves or using a slime finder tool. You can also find slimeballs by trading with a villager or by exploring shipwrecks and woodland mansion chests, although these methods are less reliable. \n\nIf you'd like to save your current slime farm location, just let me know and I'll help you with that."
